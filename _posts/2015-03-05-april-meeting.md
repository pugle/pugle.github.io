The current location is still unknown, but as soon as we are ready to let you know, we will update this page as well as our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Limburg-PHP-Meetup">Meetup</a> page.

What we do have is a speaker and a subject to talk about! Next month, our speaker will be <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonbe"><cite>Michelangelo van Dam</cite></a> who will speak about a fundamental topic: <strong class="bg-info">PHPUnit testing</strong>! Needless to say, everybody is welcome to join!

See you all next month!
