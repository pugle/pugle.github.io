### <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar"></span> When: Monday, March 2nd 2015 at 7:00PM

Next monday, the second of march, we'll host our second Limburg PHP meetup. We are thrilled to announce that Camilo  is giving a presentation about 'Coding Standards and Code Quality'.

Due to the large number of attendees we had to change location. X-Com has generously offered to host this event at their place:

<blockquote><address>X-Com<br />
Zonneveld 9<br />
5993 SG Maasbree<br />
Tel: (+31) (0)88 - 01 10 900<br />
<a href="http://www.x-com.nl/" target="_blank">www.x-com.nl</a></address></blockquote>

A big thanks to X-Com for this!

See you all next monday!
