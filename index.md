### <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar"></span> Next Meetup: Monday, April 13th 2015 at 7:00PM

#### Coding standards and code quality


Next month (April), on the second monday of the month (due to the first monday being a holiday), we will have our next meeting!
The current location is still unknown, but as soon as we are ready to let you know, we will update this page as well as our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Limburg-PHP-Meetup">Meetup</a> page.

What we do have is a speaker and a subject to talk about! Next month, our speaker will be <strong>Michelangelo van Dam</strong> who will speak about a fundamental topic: PHPUnit testing! Needless to say, everybody is welcome to join!

See you all next month!
